Work Summary
1）	Evidence for the Interaction Between KOtBu and 1,10 Phenanthroline: A Key Step for the Activation of Aryl Bromides by Electron Transfer.
 Electron paramagnetic resonance and electrochemistry are utilized to evidence the interaction between 1,10-phenanthroline (phen) and KOtBu to form 1,10-phenanthroline radical anion phen•– and tBuO• radical via an inner-sphere electron transfer. In addition, electrochemistry is also used to explain the formation of aryl radical from aryl bromide via outer-sphere electron transfer from the key intermediate phen•–. 


2）	Direct Evidence of Reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I) by Alkynes. 
X-ray absorption spectroscopy and in situ electron paramagnetic resonance evidence were provided for the reduction of Cu(II)  to Cu(I) species by alkynes in the presence of tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA). TMEDA plays dual roles as both ligand and base in the reaction. The structures of the starting Cu(II) species and the obtained Cu(I) species were determined as (TMEDA)CuCl2 and [(TMEDA)CuCl]2 dimer, respectively.
